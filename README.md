# Cancer Prediction using Naïve Bayes

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign using machine learning techniques.
The model is built using the Naïve Bayes algorithm on the Breast Cancer dataset.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Current Status
- Data loading
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Next Steps
- Feature engineering
- Model training using Naïve Bayes
- Model evaluation and visualization

## Current Status
- Data loading and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and scaling
- Train-test split completed

## Model Training
- Trained a Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier
- Model saved using joblib for reuse


## Model Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- ROC-AUC Curve
- Model performance visualized and interpreted
